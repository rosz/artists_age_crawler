# artists_age_crawler

# An exercise for writing simple web scraper:
* goes to the website of the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw
* gets the links of the individual pages of all the artists from the Museum's collection
* gets the artists' ages (by the date of birth provided in the header)
* counts the average age
